## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is needed. 
You can install miktex, see https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex-unx, or other tex distributions.
I personally compile my files with Latexmk. Instructions on how to install it can be found at https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html.

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run:

```bash
$ latexmk --pdf {filename}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{filename}.pdf``.

## Contact

You are free to use the code to create your own cv. Please don't use it for commercial purposes though, as it is intended to be shared for free.

Have fun!
