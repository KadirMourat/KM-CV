# KM-CV

KM CV LaTeX template for generating a Curriculum Vitae.

## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is needed. 
You can install miktex, see https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex-unx, or other tex distributions.
I personally compile my files with Latexmk. Instructions on how to install it can be found at https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html.

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run:

```bash
$ latexmk --pdf {filename}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{filename}.pdf``.

## Contact

Have fun!
